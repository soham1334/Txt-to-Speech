# Requirements: Plugin-Based Data Ingester SDK

## 1. Vision & Scope

*   **1.1. Vision:** A flexible and extensible data ingestion SDK for Godspeed projects.
*   **1.2. Scope:** The project deliverable is an SDK library, to be published as a package, not a standalone application. It will feature a core orchestrator configurable with source and destination plugins.

## 2. Core Principles

*   **2.1. Plugin Architecture:** Data sources and destinations shall be implemented as discrete, interchangeable plugins.
*   **2.2. Extensibility:** The SDK shall provide a clear and stable interface for third-party plugin development.
*   **2.3. Usability:** The SDK's public API shall be simple and intuitive.
*   **2.4. Reliability:** The SDK shall incorporate robust error handling, logging, and state management capabilities.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1. Core Ingestion Orchestrator

*   **3.1.1.** The SDK shall provide a central orchestrator to manage the data ingestion lifecycle for individual tasks.
*   **3.1.2.** The orchestrator shall be configurable with one source and one destination plugin per instance.
*   **3.1.3.** The orchestrator shall provide programmatic controls to execute and monitor a single ingestion process.

### 3.2. Global Triggering and State Management

*   **3.2.1.** The SDK shall provide a centralized, global system for managing the lifecycle of all ingestion instances.
*   **3.2.2.** This system shall use two primary strategies for triggering ingestion: webhooks and cron jobs.
*   **3.2.3.** The system shall be responsible for all state management, including the scheduling, de-scheduling, updating, and deleting of ingestion tasks.

### 3.3. Source Plugin Capabilities

*   **3.3.1. Web/HTTP Source:**
    *   **3.3.1.1.** The SDK shall be capable of ingesting content from web URLs.
    *   **3.3.1.2.** The source must support content discovery via sitemap parsing.
    *   **3.3.1.3.** The source must support content discovery via recursive link crawling.
*   **3.3.2. Version Control System (VCS) Source:**
    *   **3.3.2.1.** The SDK shall be capable of ingesting from Git-based repositories.
    *   **3.3.2.2.** The source must be configurable by repository URL and branch.
*   **3.3.3. Cloud File Storage Source:**
    *   **3.3.3.1.** The SDK shall be capable of ingesting files from common cloud storage providers (e.g., Google Drive, AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage).
    *   **3.3.3.2.** The source must support secure authentication with the cloud provider.
    *   **3.3.3.3.** The source must be able to monitor a specified storage location.

### 3.4. Destination Plugin Capabilities

*   **3.4.1. Generic API Endpoint Destination:**
    *   **3.4.1.1.** The SDK shall be capable of sending data to a generic HTTP/S API endpoint.
    *   **3.4.1.2.** The destination must be configurable with the endpoint URL.
    *   **3.4.1.3.** The destination must support configurable authentication mechanisms.
    *   **3.4.1.4.** The destination must support batching of data.

## 4. Plugin Development Interface Requirements

*   **4.1.** The SDK shall provide a clear, stable, and well-documented set of programming interfaces for creating custom plugins.
*   **4.2.** The source plugin interface shall provide for initialization, triggering, and standardized status/data reporting.
*   **4.3.** The destination plugin interface shall provide for initialization, sending individual and batched data, and standardized status reporting for asynchronous operations.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **5.1. Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation shall be provided, including a getting-started guide, a detailed API reference, and a plugin development tutorial.
*   **5.2. Testing:** The SDK shall have a high level of automated test coverage, including unit and integration tests.
*   **5.3. Packaging:** The SDK shall be published as a package to a public or private npm registry.
